# GUI for Curl

[![MAUI Desktop (.NET 10)](https://github.com/majian55555/Curl_Maui/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/majian55555/Curl_Maui/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml)

A cross-platform HTTP client desktop application built with .NET MAUI that provides a graphical interface for making HTTP GET requests, similar to the command-line tool `curl`. The application allows you to send requests with custom headers and view responses in various formats (images, videos, or text).

## Demo

## Features

- **HTTP GET Requests**: Send HTTP GET requests to any URL
- **Non-2xx Response Handling**: Non-success HTTP status codes (4xx, 5xx, etc.) are displayed rather than treated as errors — you see the response body and headers for any status
- **Custom Headers**: Add up to 3 custom header key-value pairs to your requests
- **Response Display**: Automatically detects and displays:
  - **Images**: View image responses directly in the application
  - **Videos**: Play video responses (MP4 format) with built-in media player
  - **Text**: Display text/JSON/HTML responses in an editable editor
- **Response Information**: View detailed response information, including:
  - HTTP status code
  - Content headers
  - Response headers
- **Request Timer**: Track how long each request takes to complete
- **Save Responses**: Save downloaded content (images, videos, or text) to your Downloads folder
- **Config Persistence**: Automatically saves and restores your URL and header configurations
- **Request Cancellation**: Cancel in-progress requests if needed
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows and macOS right now. But it should be easy to add Android and iOS

## Requirements

- .NET 10.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 (17.14 or later) with .NET MAUI workload, or
- Visual Studio Code with C# extension and .NET MAUI extension
- Platform-specific requirements:
  - **Windows**: Windows 10 version 17763.0 or later
  - **Mac Catalyst**: macOS 15.0 or later

## Installation

### Install Dotnet and .NET MAUI

We need .NET version 10

[Install .NET on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows)

[Install MAUI on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation?view=net-maui-10.0&tabs=visual-studio-code)

[Install .NET on macOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/macos)

[Install MAUI on macOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation?view=net-maui-10.0&tabs=visual-studio-code)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Curl_Maui
```

### Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

## Building

### Build for Windows

```bash
dotnet build -f net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0 -c Release -p:RuntimeIdentifierOverride=win10-x64
```

### Publish for Windows

```bash
dotnet publish -f net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0 -c Release -p:RuntimeIdentifierOverride=win10-x64
```

### Publish for Mac Catalyst (requires Xcode 26.2 or later)

```bash
dotnet publish -f net10.0-maccatalyst -c Release -p:CreatePackage=false
```

> **Note**: The macOS CI build is currently disabled in GitHub Actions because the hosted `macos-latest` runner does not yet ship Xcode 26.2. The Windows CI build runs on every push and pull request.

## Usage

1. **Enter URL**: Type or paste the URL you want to request in the "URL" field
2. **Add Headers (Optional)**: Fill in up to 3 custom header key-value pairs if needed
3. **Send Request**: Click the "Send URL request" button
4. **View Response**: 
   - Images will be displayed automatically
   - Videos will play in the built-in media player
   - Text/JSON/HTML will be shown in an editor
5. **View Headers**: Check the right panel for response code, content headers, and response headers
6. **Save Content**: Click "Save File" to save the response to your Downloads folder
7. **Cancel Request**: Use "Cancel URL request" to stop an in-progress request

### Configuration Persistence

The application automatically saves your URL and header configurations when you close the app. These settings will be restored the next time you launch the application.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET MAUI 10.0**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **CommunityToolkit.Maui**: Community toolkit for MAUI with MediaElement support
- **NLog**: Logging framework
- **OneOf**: Discriminated union library for error handling
- **HttpClient**: For making HTTP requests

## Key Components

- **MainPageVm**: Handles HTTP requests, response processing, and content type detection
- **DialogService**: Provides platform-agnostic dialog and alert functionality
- **StaticValues**: Manages file paths for configuration and saved content
- **Extensions**: Utility extension methods for tasks, exceptions, and collections

## Notes

- Requests have a default timeout of 60 seconds
- Video responses are temporarily saved to the app data directory and cleaned up on app close
- Saved files are stored in your Downloads folder with sanitized filenames based on the URL
- The application uses `ConfigureAwait(false)` throughout for better async performance
